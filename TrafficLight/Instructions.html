        <h3>Welcome to the Traffic Light Game</h3>

        <p>
            In this game, you will participate in <strong>{{ total_rounds }} rounds</strong>.
            Your goal is to cross the finish line while maximizing your endowment.
        </p>

        <h5>How to Play:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>You start each round with an endowment of <strong>20 points</strong>.</li>
            <li>The endowment decreases by <strong>1 point every second</strong> while you wait.</li>
            <li>The traffic light starts <strong>RED</strong> and will turn <strong>GREEN</strong> at a random time
                (between 10-20 seconds).</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Crossing the Street:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>You can choose to <strong>Cross (Move)</strong> at any time by pressing the button.</li>
            <li><strong>Waiting for Green:</strong> If you wait until the light turns Green, you automatically cross
                safely. Your score is your remaining endowment.</li>
            <li><strong>Moving on Red:</strong> You can choose to cross while the light is Red to save time (and
                points).
                <ul>
                    <li>However, there is a chance you might be <strong>CAUGHT</strong>!</li>
                    {% if punishment %}
                    <li>If you are caught crossing on Red, you will receive a <strong>penalty of {{ penalty }}
                            points</strong> (Score: -{{ penalty }}).</li>
                    <li>The probability of being caught is <strong>90%</strong>.</li>
                    {% else %}
                    <li>(Punishment is currently disabled).</li>
